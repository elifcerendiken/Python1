#Define a variable to represent a person’s name and another variable to define the object (e.g. name of a pro- gramming language) in a sentence, and print a message to that person. 
#Your message should be simple, such as:
#• Hello Emma, would you like to learn some Python today? 
#• Hello Alice, would you like to learn some Java today?
#Your program should print different combinations of this message for different persons with different objects.
